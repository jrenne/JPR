    "title": "House price boom/bust cycles: identification issues and macro-prudential implications",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Over the recent months, several initiatives have taken place to develop macro-prudential regulation in order to prevent systemic risk and the build-up of financial imbalances. These discussions took place in the aftermath of the recent financial crisis that is the consequence of the bust of an house price bubble that took place in the US and spread out to most developed countries. Crucial to the success of such policy is the ability of the macro-prudential authority to identify in due time such imbalances, generally featured by asset price boom-bust cycles. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of detecting house price booms according to alternative identification strategies and assess their robustness. In addition, we try to disentangle costless or low-cost from costly house price booms. Resorting both to a non-parametric approach and a discrete-choice (logit) model, we analyze the ability of a set of indicators to robustly explain costly house price booms. According to our results, real long term interest rates, total investment, real credit and real stock prices tend to increase the probability of a costly house price boom.\n\nLink to article"

    "text": "Microeconometrics (MSc)\nOnline material\nIn microeconometric models, the variables of interest often feature restricted distributions–for instance with discontinuous support–, which necessitates specific models. Typical examples are discrete-choice models (binary, multinomial, ordered outcomes), sample selection models (censored or truncated outcomes), and count-data models (integer outcomes). The course describes the estimation and interpretation of these models. It also shows how the discrete-choice models can emerge from (structural) random-utility frameworks."

These responses correspond to the effect, over time, of an exogenous intervention that propagates through the economy, as modeled by a system of simultaneous equations. Over the last decades, several methodologies have been proposed so as to estimate these responses. The objective of this course, developed jointly with Kenza Benhima, is to provide an exhaustive view of these methodologies and to provide students with tools enabling them to implement them in various contexts."

A first part presents the discrete-time affine processes and their properties. It highlights the richness of these processes and shows how they can conveniently be incorporated within asset-pricing frameworks. A second part presents various applications. It focuses in particular on the pricing of commodity-related financial products, interest rates, credit, liquidity, contagion and systemic risks."
