    "section": "",
    "text": "In the wake of the Great Recession, a massive monetary policy stimulus was provided in the main OECD economies. It helped to stabilise financial markets and avoid deflation. Nonetheless, GDP growth has been sluggish and in some countries lower than expected given the measures taken, and estimated economic slack remains large. In this context, this paper assesses the effectiveness of monetary policy in recent years. It finds that notwithstanding an almost full transmission of policy interest rate cuts and unconventional policy measures to higher asset prices and lower cost of credit in and outside the banking sector in most countries, with the exception of vulnerable euro area economies, monetary policy stimulus did not show up in stronger growth due to a combination of three factors. First, lower policy interest rates may not have provided as much stimulus as expected given the evidence of a decrease in natural interest rates, resulting from the estimated decline in potential GDP growth in the wake of the crisis. Second, balance sheet adjustments of non-financial companies and households, large uncertainty as well as simultaneous and considerable fiscal consolidation in many OECD countries constituted important headwinds. Third, the bank lending channel of monetary policy transmission appears to have been impaired, mainly due to considerable balance sheet adjustments and prevailing uncertainty, which together limited banks’ capacity and willingness to supply credit. The paper also stresses that the monetary accommodation risks having unintended negative consequences which are likely to increase with its duration.\n\nLink to paper"

Exploring the regime-switching feature of Markov chains, the proposed model focuses on discrete changes in the central bank policy rates – the main driver of short-term rate fluctuations. An empirical analysis shows that the proposed model generally outperforms other standard short-term rate models in fitting cross-sections of options prices. Moreover, the explicit nature of policy rates, to some extent, enables the model to infer risk-neutral probabilities of the central-bank rate decisions.\n\nLink to journal's website"

The Kalman filter simultaneously estimates the output gap and the natural rate of interest. Our identifying assumptions include a close relationship between the TVNRI and the low-frequency fluctuations of potential output growth.

To achieve this, we rely on the properties of compound auto-regressive (Car) processes. The usefulness of these processes in the building of risk-free (non-defaultable) bond pricing models is now well documented (see Darolles, Gourieroux and Jasiak, 2006, Gourieroux and Monfort, 2007, Monfort and Pegoraro, 2007 or Le, Singleton and Da, 2011).

The regimes can be used to capture stochastic drifts and/or volatilities, to represent discrete target rates, to incorporate business cycles or crises, to introduce contagion, to reproduce zero lower bound spells, or to evaluate the impact of standard or nonstandard monetary policies. From a technical point of view, we stress the key role of Markov chains, Compound Autoregressive (Car) processes, Regime Switching Car processes and multihorizon Laplace transforms.\n\nLink to journal's website"

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper proposes long-run estimates of ex ante real interest rates in Switzerland and other developed economies, and it describes their relative evolution. Our results highlight the decline in—and convergence of—global real interest rates that has unfolded over the last three decades for all maturities. While Swiss yields stand out as being particularly low and stable from a historical perspective, we find that Swiss interest rates have fallen less than in many other countries during the last decade. We then examine whether the reduction in the interest differential is related to a lower attractiveness of the Swiss franc. Focusing on the difference of Swiss minus German real government bonds yields, we find a significant increase in expected real depreciation of the Swiss franc and a somewhat lower convenience yield for Swiss bonds—the convenience yield reflecting the non-pecuniary value that investors impute to the liquidity of a given bond. In contrast, the safety premium in favor of the Swiss franc increased and therefore cannot explain the smaller decline in real interest rates in Switzerland. The last part of the paper analyzes the negative convenience yield on Swiss government bonds and its recent decline. We show that both the purchase of government bonds by foreign central banks and foreign exchange interventions by the Swiss National Bank may have contributed to this decline by reducing the relative supply of foreign versus domestic government bonds.\n\nLink to journal's website"

    "text": "We develop a dynamic term structure model of sovereign credit risk based on the concept of fiscal fatigue. According to this concept, when debt is high, stabilizing it requires large surpluses, but these surpluses are difficult to maintain over long periods, which gives rise to sovereign credit risk. We define fiscal limits as the level of debt that would imply a given probability of default at a given horizon. Exploiting approximate bond pricing formulas, we extract the information contained in the term structure of sovereign credit spreads to retrieve time-varying estimates of fiscal limit and fiscal space—the distance between the limit and actual debt. An empirical exercise covers eight countries, including advanced and emerging economies, from 2007 to 2022. We find substantial temporal variation in our estimates of fiscal limit and fiscal space. Estimated fiscal spaces comove negatively with economic policy uncertainty and bond market volatility, and positively with the central bank’s balance sheet.\n\nLink to paper on SSRN"

Bringing macroeconomic structure to a no-arbitrage asset-pricing framework, we exploit prices of disaster-exposed assets (credit and equity derivatives) to extract information on (i) the expected influence of a disastrous default on consumption and (ii) the probability of a financial meltdown. Using European data, we find that the returns of disaster-exposed assets are consistent with a systemic default being followed by a 2% decrease in consumption. The recessionary influence of disastrous defaults implies that financial instruments whose payoffs are exposed to such credit events carry substantial risk premiums. We also produce systemic risk indicators based on the probability of observing a certain number of systemic defaults or a sharp drop of consumption.\n\nLink to journal's website\n\n\nLink to preprint"

They consider both interest cost and budget balance and use a wide range of econometric tools to model the French economy and the dynamics of budget balance. Based on this quantitative analysis, they come up with the following results: by saving the inflation risk premium, the government can lower the average debt service when increasing the share of indexed debt, but if the increase is strong, it also makes the debt service more variable. However, the conclusion is also that, starting from 0%, increasing indexed debt up to a moderate level (around 20%) would lead to a decrease in expected interest payments without significantly increasing the variability of the budget balance.\n\nLink to chapter"

We consider two types of bonds; the first is backed by several and joint guarantees (SJGs), and the second features several but not joint guarantees (SNJGs). The pricing of SJG and SNJG bonds reflects different assumptions regarding the pooling of debtors’ fiscal resources. We estimate fiscal limits for the six larg- est euro-area economies over 2008–2021 and deduce counterfactual Eurobond prices. For the five-year maturity, SNJG bond yield spreads would have been about three times larger than SJG ones over the estimation sample. Hence, issuing SJG bonds could result in gains at the aggregate level. Notwithstanding, our model also predicts that gains may temporar- ily vanish in periods of acute fiscal stress. We finally envision postissuance redistribution schemes, whereby gains stemming from the issuance of SJG bonds could be shared among participating countries; we argue that these schemes may alleviate the reduction in market discipline resulting from common bonds issuance.\n\nLink to journal's website"

    "text": "The basic assumption of a structural vector autoregressive moving average (SVARMA) model is that it is driven by a white noise whose components are uncorrelated or independent and can be interpreted as economic shocks, called “structural” shocks. When the errors are Gaussian, independence is equivalent to non-correlation and these models face two identification issues. The first identification problem is “static” and is due to the fact that there is an infinite number of linear transformations of a given random vector making its components uncorrelated. The second identification problem is “dynamic” and is a consequence of the fact that, even if a SVARMA admits a non-invertible moving average (MA) matrix polynomial, it may feature the same second-order dynamic properties as a VARMA process in which the MA matrix polynomials are invertible (the fundamental representation). The aim of this article is to explain that these difficulties are mainly due to the Gaussian assumption, and that both identification challenges are solved in a non-Gaussian framework if the structural shocks are assumed to be instantaneously and serially independent. We develop new parametric and semi-parametric estimation methods that accommodate non-fundamentalness in the MA dynamics. The functioning and performances of these methods are illustrated by applications conducted on both simulated and real data.\n\nLink to journal's website"

The default indicator is replaced by an appropriate prediction and the prediction error, that is the default-event surprise, is neglected. Our paper develops an approach to get closed-form expressions for the prices of credit derivatives written on multiple names without neglecting default-event surprises. This approach differs from the standard one, since the default counts necessarily cause the factor process under the risk-neutral probability, even if this is not the case under the historical probability. This implies that the standard exponential pricing formula of default does not apply. Using the US bond data, we show that allowing for the pricing of default events has important implications in terms of both data-fitting and model-implied physical probabilities of default. In particular, it may provide a solution to the credit spread puzzle.

The model, inspired by Rudebusch and Wu (2008), is estimated on euro-area data over the period 1999-2009. At business-cycle fre- quencies, the variance of interest payments is lower when nominal long-term bonds are issued. From a budget-smoothing perspective, debt service variabil- ity plays a major role, but pro- or counter-cyclicality of debt service also matters.

The estimation of the model, based on daily euro-area yield data, reveals the strong influence of the monetary-policy phases on the shape of the yield curve. This relationship can, in turn, be exploited to estimate the probabilities of being in the different monetary-policy phases.

For that purpose, a dynamic factor model is estimated using Kalman Filtering techniques. In addition to separating common and country-specific - idiosyncratic - developments of output, we try to identify the causes underlying the observed co-movement: to what extent is it driven by common shocks and to what extent can cross-country/cross-area spill-over effects account for the observed co-movement? We find that the output developments in G7 countries are driven to a substantial extent by common dynamics. A significant part of the co-movement, especially in the first half of the sample, can be explained by developments in the price of oil, an important and easily identifiable common shock. The analysis suggests that, in addition, area-specific common factors play an important role, separating the sample into a North American (US, Canada) and a continental European (France, Germany, Italy) area, with the UK and Japan being somewhat separate from these areas. We find that developments in the North American factor have a strong lagged impact on the continental European factor, while the reverse is not true. Furthermore, the strength of the cross-area spillovers from America to Europe appears to have become stronger over the sample period, suggesting that international linkages have increased in the process of globalization.\n\nLink to CEPR DP website\n\n\nLink to EABCN website"

    "text": "Since 2001, Agence France Trésor has been managing the average maturity of debt. In “normal” circumstances, characterised by a rising rate curve, with higher long rates and weaker but more volatile short rates, reducing this average maturity should make it possible to reduce interest costs on average over a long period, all things being equal. On the other hand, this increases the variability of this expense. Average debt maturity management therefore requires quantitative assessment of the compromise between average interest payments and payments variability. This paper aims at providing such an assessment. More precisely, the objective of the proposed approach is to compare the performances of financing strategies implying different average debt maturities. A macro-finance model is estimated on historical data and further used in order to stochastically generate future macro-finance scenarios. Each financing strategy is then applied under these scenarios, which provides us with average interest payments (cost measure) and the variability of these payments (risk measure) associated with this strategy.\n\nLink to paper"

    "text": "Microeconometrics (MSc)\nOnline material\nIn microeconometric models, the variables of interest often feature restricted distributions–for instance with discontinuous support–, which necessitates specific models. Typical examples are discrete-choice models (binary, multinomial, ordered outcomes), sample selection models (censored or truncated outcomes), and count-data models (integer outcomes). The course describes the estimation and interpretation of these models. It also shows how the discrete-choice models can emerge from (structural) random-utility frameworks."

    "text": "The Identification of Dynamic Structural Shocks (Ph.D.)\nOnline material\nThe identification and estimation of dynamic responses to structural shocks is one of the principal goals of macroeconometrics. These responses correspond to the effect, over time, of an exogenous intervention that propagates through the economy, as modeled by a system of simultaneous equations. Over the last decades, several methodologies have been proposed so as to estimate these responses. The objective of this course, developed jointly with Kenza Benhima, is to provide an exhaustive view of these methodologies and to provide students with tools enabling them to implement them in various contexts."

    "text": "Dynamic Pricing with Discrete Time Affine Processes (Ph.D.)\nThis course, developed with Alain Monfort, shows how discrete time affine processes can be used to derive asset prices and to model their dynamics. A first part presents the discrete-time affine processes and their properties. It highlights the richness of these processes and shows how they can conveniently be incorporated within asset-pricing frameworks. A second part presents various applications. It focuses in particular on the pricing of commodity-related financial products, interest rates, credit, liquidity, contagion and systemic risks."
